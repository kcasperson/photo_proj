<p> Hello! I am a talented mom with an eye for the fantastic.
  From the tiniest of micro miracles to the vastness of the gloom in winter,
  I see and present beauty in each portrait I take of the world I live in.</p>

<p> Hailing from a small town, I live a comfortable life in the company of my
  wonderful husband, Wayne, and youngest daughter, Hannah. My oldest daughter lives
  in Provo, UT and is the creator of this website. She and her husband are expecting
  our first grandchild and we couldn't be more happy. </p>
<p> After decades of working with children and loving little busy bodies, I took
  a couragous leap into new hobbies in the Spring of 2017. Photography, doting on Wayne
  and my puppers, and running a lovely household are three of my favorite current pastimes.
  I have taken on the challenge of "A Year with my iPhone." This challenge inspires me
  to consistently produce more photos and look outside of myself for fantastic things. </p>
